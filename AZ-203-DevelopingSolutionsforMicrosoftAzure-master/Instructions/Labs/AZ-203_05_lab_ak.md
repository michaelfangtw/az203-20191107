# Lab: Monitoring services deployed to Azure
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

    1.  In the **Test Type** list, select **Manual Test**.
    
    1.  In the **URL** field, update the URL by appending the suffix **/api/values** to the end of the current URL.

        > **Note**: For example, if your URL is http://smpapistudent.azurewebsites.net, the new URL would be http://smpapistudent.azurewebsites.net/api/values.

    1.  Select **Done**.

1.  Back in the **New performance test** blade, select **Run test**.

1.  Back in the **Performance test** section, in the list of **Recent runs,** select **LoadTest**.

1. In the **LoadTest** blade, wait for the test to start before you proceed with the lab.

    > **Note**: Most load tests take about 10 to 15 minutes to gather the resources and start. You can wait at this blade because it will automatically refresh when the load testing is started.

1. Wait for the load test to finish before you proceed with the lab. Observe the live chart updating as your API app experiences increased usage.

    > **Note**: The load test will take the 10 minutes you specified in the previous steps of the lab.

#### Task 2: Use Azure Monitor metrics after performance test

1.  In the left navigation pane of the Azure portal, select **All services**.

1.  In the **All services** blade, select **Monitor**.

1.  In the **Monitor** blade, on the left side of the blade, select **Metrics**.

1.  In the **Metrics** section, perform the following actions:
    
    1.  In the **Resource** section, select **Select a resource**.
    
    1.  In the **Select a resource** window that appears, in the **Resource group** list, select **MonitoredAssets**. Then, in the **Resource** list, select the **instrm\*** Application Insights account option. Finally, select **Apply** to close the window and confirm your selection.
    
    1.  In the **Metric Namespace** list, in the **Standard** category, select **Standard metrics (preview)**.
    
    1.  In the **Metric** list, in the **Performance Counter** category, select **Process CPU**.
    
    1.  In the **Aggregation** list, select **Avg**.
    
    1.  At the top of the section, select **Last 24 hours (Automatic - 5 minutes)**. In the window that appears, in the **Time range** category, select **Last 30 minutes** and then select **Apply** to save your selection.
    
    1.  At the top of the section, select **Line chart**. In the menu that appears, select **Area chart**.

1.  Observe your newly created chart.

1.  At the top of the section, select **Add metric**.

1.  In the **Metrics** section, perform the following actions with the new metric item in the list:
    
    1.  In the **Metric Namespace** list, in the **Standard** category, select **Log-based metrics**.
    
    1.  In the **Metric** list, in the **Server** category, select **Server response time**.
    
    1. In the **Aggregation** list, select **Avg**.

1.  Observe your updated chart. Observe the information displayed in your chart. You can observe how the server response time correlates with the CPU time as load on the application increased.

#### Review

In this exercise, you performed a performance (load) test of your API app by using the tools available to you in Azure. After you performed the load test, you were able to measure your API app’s behavior by using metrics in the Azure Monitor interface.

### Exercise 5: Clean up subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1.  At the top of the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1.  At the bottom of the portal in the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, type the following command and press Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```
    az group list
    ```

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to view a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to delete the **MonitoredAssets** resource group:

    ```
    az group delete --name MonitoredAssets --no-wait --yes
    ```
    
1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close active applications

1.  Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

1.  Close the currently running **Visual Studio Code** application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the **resource groups** used in this lab.
